            Jar Jar Binks was the first Gungan to represent his people in the Galactic Senate, first serving as a Junior Representative along with Senator Padmé Amidala, and then, after her death, serving as full Senator himself. Like most Gungans, Binks was lanky and spoke Basic with a unique accent. Being naïve and clumsy, Jar Jar Binks contributed greatly to the fall of the Galactic Republic. He was a General, Representative, and later a Senator.

            Binks was also one of Qui-Gon Jinn's companions during the Invasion of Naboo, traveling to distant worlds such as Tatooine and Coruscant, an activity not taken up by many Gungans. On his return to Naboo, he served as a Bombad General for a short while in the Gungan Grand Army, and was a joint commander of the Battle of the Great Grass Plains with General Ceel. Binks later helped his people colonize the nearby Naboo moon Ohma-D'un. During his career as Junior Representative, he acted as Amidala's proxy and proposed giving Supreme Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers in order to deal with the Separatist Crisis. Binks would continue his public service even after the death of Amidala, taking her place as Senator of the Chommell sector in the newly-reformed Imperial Senate.
